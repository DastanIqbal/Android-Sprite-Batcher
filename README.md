Android-Sprite-Batcher
======================
Sprite Batcher is a tool to help draw 2D sprites in Android using OpenGL. It handles all the interaction with the OpenGL client and offers you a set of simple draw() methods to handle all your drawing needs.

*Getting SpriteBatcher*

1. Get a copy of the repo by either:
	- Forking/cloning (all you GitHub officianados will already know how to do this!)
	- Downloading directly as a .zip file using the button near the top of the screen
2. a) Using a library project:
	- Import the entire Android-Sprite-Batcher project folder into Eclipse using File -> Import -> Existing Android Code Into Workspace. 
	- Right click on the newly imported project and click Properties -> Android -> check 'Is Library'
	- Right click on your application that you want to use Sprite Batcher in and click Properties -> Android -> Under libraries click 'add' and select the Android-Sprite-Batcher.

2. b) Using a JAR:
	- Simply copy the Android-Sprite-Batcher-vX.X.jar from the releases folder into the lib folder of your Android project.
	- Note: you will not have access to the javadoc markup by going this route, whereas if you use the library project you will.

3. Watch the videos below to see how to use it:

* NB The first 1m40s of the first video shows you how to grab the code from my personal website www.ionage.co.uk. As you have already got the code from GitHub you can skip that bit.
